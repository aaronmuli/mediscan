#Mediscan: X-Ray Analysis Tool
Mediscan is a web application built with Flask that allows users to upload medical X-ray images for automated classification and analysis. It utilizes a pre-trained Deep Learning model (e.g., a CNN) to predict the class of the X-ray (e.g., 'normal' or 'abnormal') and provides confidence probabilities.

#Features
Secure File Upload: Handles image uploads and secures filenames.

Deep Learning Inference: Runs uploaded images through a medical image analysis model.

Prediction Output: Displays the predicted class and detailed probabilities for each category.

CPU/GPU Support: Designed for flexible deployment environments.
